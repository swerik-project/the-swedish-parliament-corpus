## Status

Decided

Decision: approved

## Context
Some MPs don't belong to a particular party. There are different ways of storing this _partil√∂s_, _vilde_, NaN, etc. 

Further, there are additional specifications about types of _vilde_ which may or may not encroach on what constitutes a party.

## Decision
Decide which non-party labels constitute the same partylessness category and unify the ID used.

"Utan partibeteckning" --- "Independent politician" --- "Q327591"

## Consequences
More consistent labelling of party membership.

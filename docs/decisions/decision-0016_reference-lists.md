# Where to store references

## Context

We have a bibtex database that contains references for the project. The question is whether to store a unified list for all SWERIK repos or one reference repository per SWERIK repo.

## Decision

Per executive decree, we have one reference list per repo.

## Consequences

Every repo gets its own bibtex database.
